# Plan 07-02: Kanban Board Component

**Phase:** 07 - Electron GUI
**Plan:** 07-02
**Objective:** Create a Kanban board component for visualizing and managing tasks across Planning, In Progress, and Done columns with drag-and-drop support.

## Context

Plan 07-01 established the Electron shell with React, IPC bridge, and basic components. This plan builds on that foundation to create an interactive Kanban board that visualizes project tasks and allows status updates through drag-and-drop.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Kanban Board Components
**Location:** `momentum/electron/renderer/components/Kanban/`

Create the following React components:

1. **KanbanBoard.jsx** - Main board container
   - Render three columns (Planning, In Progress, Done)
   - Handle drag-and-drop context
   - Load tasks from IPC bridge
   - Manage board state

2. **KanbanColumn.jsx** - Individual column component
   - Accept column title and tasks
   - Render drop zone
   - Handle drop events
   - Display task count

3. **KanbanCard.jsx** - Task/plan card component
   - Display task/plan information
   - Make draggable
   - Show metadata (phase, dates, etc.)
   - Support click to view details

4. **KanbanFilters.jsx** - Filter controls
   - Filter by phase
   - Filter by status
   - Search tasks
   - Clear filters button

**Verification:**
- [ ] All component files created
- [ ] Components export properly
- [ ] PropTypes defined for all components
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works between columns

### Task 2: Add Kanban Styles
**Location:** `momentum/electron/renderer/components/Kanban/kanban.css`

Create comprehensive styles:
- Board layout (flexbox/grid)
- Column styling with distinct colors
- Card styling with shadows and hover effects
- Drag-and-drop visual feedback
- Filter controls styling
- Responsive design considerations

**Verification:**
- [ ] CSS file created
- [ ] Styles imported in components
- [ ] Drag states styled appropriately
- [ ] Responsive on different screen sizes

### Task 3: Wire Up to CLI Data
**Integration:** Connect Kanban board to Momentum CLI data

1. **Load Tasks from Roadmap**
   - Use IPC bridge to fetch roadmap data
   - Parse tasks from ROADMAP.md
   - Map tasks to Kanban structure
   - Handle initial load

2. **Update Status via IPC**
   - Implement IPC handler for status updates
   - Update task status when card dropped
   - Persist changes to roadmap file
   - Handle update errors

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Subscribe to roadmap change events
   - Update board when external changes occur
   - Handle concurrent updates
   - Show sync status indicator

**Verification:**
- [ ] Tasks load from CLI on mount
- [ ] Drag-and-drop updates persist to roadmap
- [ ] Board syncs when roadmap changes externally
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Kanban board displays tasks in three columns
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly between columns
- [ ] Status updates persist to ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Filters work correctly
- [ ] Real-time sync with CLI data
- [ ] Responsive and visually polished
- [ ] No console errors

## Dependencies

- Plan 07-01 (Electron shell, IPC bridge, basic components)
- Momentum CLI roadmap system
- React DnD library or HTML5 drag-and-drop API

## Notes

- Consider using react-beautiful-dnd or @dnd-kit/core for drag-and-drop
- Ensure performance with many tasks (virtualization if needed)
- Add loading states during IPC calls
- Include empty states for columns with no tasks
